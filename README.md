# WhiteLabel-Hack-the-Crisis-Nederlands
This is my contribution to the WhiteLabel project, during the online hackathon "Hack the Crisis - Netherlands edition". Here's the full project: https://github.com/GiovanniBalestrieri/autodichiarazione_2.0

## How does it work?

The program uses auto declarations from users. In this simulation the declarations are created from "auto-declarations-generator.py", and stored on a Tangle quantum-resistant blockchain. In the "WhiteLabel-trip-animator.py" oordinates are collected and displayed on an anonymized map. If two trips intersect, a flag raises. If one of the user is an asymptomatic, or has Covid-19, close users can be notified.
